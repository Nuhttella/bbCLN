        <p> Thank you for saying Yes! ðŸ¥º</p>
        <p>I know this isn't enough to repair the damages I did, as of now this is the only effort I can give. I know you have been 
            so so so tired. With all the tasks, OJT, everything and also me. I hope this can cheer you up! I know I said many times
            I'll change but it never really happens. So I took the time to try and gather my thoughts. I realized I couldn't bear the
            silence if we split apart. I love you so much!ðŸ’– I believe that love begins with sacrifice! So I will Start Today! ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–
